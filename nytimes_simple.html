<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="767" data-total-count="1896" itemprop="articleBody">Jerry van Schaik, a Dutch entrepreneur who has lived in the city since 2001, recalled the height of the Old Town’s redevelopment, from 2010 to 2012, when teams from big companies like Heineken scoured the streets to negotiate contracts with all the new bars popping up. “There was this craziness,” Mr. van Schaik said over coffee in <a href="http://vangogh.ro/">Grand Cafe Van Gogh</a>, a laid-back cafe in the Old Town that he owned until recently. Next door is the <a href="http://www.rembrandt.ro/">Rembrandt Hotel</a>, the boutique hotel he opened in 2005. Mr. van Schaik began his first venture in the area, Amsterdam Cafe, in 2002, when the Old Town was not a hot destination for most locals. “At that time it was more of a village feel,” he said. “But it was lively, with a lot of cars and a lot of business going on.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="2244" itemprop="articleBody">The Old Town, less than a square mile of neo-Classical and neo-Baroque buildings, was traditionally one of the city’s main areas of commerce, occupied by merchants, beautiful churches and traditional inns. But the area fell into disrepair during the Communist era that ended in 1989, with many businesses moving out and poorer families moving in.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="372" data-total-count="2616" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-3">“This area was totally derelict, and nobody particularly wanted to go there,” said Corvin Cristian, a young Romanian architect and designer who created the interiors of some of the trendiest establishments today in the Old Town, including <a href="http://thedivan.ro/home">Divan</a>, a Turkish restaurant, and <a href="http://www.lacrimisisfinti.com/">Lacrimi si Sfinti</a>, a restaurant that specializes in modern takes on traditional Romanian dishes.</p><figure id="media-100000004022793" class="media photo embedded has-adjacency layout-large-horizontal media-100000004022793 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/15/travel/15HEADS3/15HEADS3-articleLarge.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">
